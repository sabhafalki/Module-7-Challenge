# Overview of Project #
The purpose of this Project is to create an entire Employee database using six csv files to help Pewlett Hackard company for the upcoming “Silver Tsunami”. By notifying a potential trend of a large chunk of employees retiring recently.Pewlett Hackard wants detailed information on the number of future retirees from all departments currently working at the company to be able to prepare a plan to hire new staff and also to prepare a mentorship initiative.

The analysis consisted of the following:
1. Identify the retiring employees by their title.
2. Determine the sum of retiring employees grouped by title.
3. Identify the employees eligible for participation in the mentorship program.
4. Determine the number of roles-to-fill grouped by title and department.
5. Determine the number of qualified, retirement-ready employees to mentor. the next generation grouped by title and department.
